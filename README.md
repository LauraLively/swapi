Star Wars API

--------------------------

This demo app was built as part of a coding challenge with the Star Wars API (https://swapi.co/)

--------------------------

How to run app locally

npm start

--------------------------

At present all the data from SWAPI.com is being pulled and displayed in the console.
I need to get the data rendered on the pages. And fix the function to extract the names of the planet residents.
